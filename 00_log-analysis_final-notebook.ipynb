    "#### 1. Across programs, which lesson attracts the most traffic consistently across cohorts?\n",
    "> This is an answer.\n",
    "#### 2. Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more that other cohorts seemed to gloss over?\n",
    "#### 3. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? \n",
    "    - If so, what information do you have about these students?\n",
    "#### 4. Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldnâ€™t be? \n",
    "    - Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses?\n",
    "#### 5. At some point in 2019, the ability for students and alumni to access both curriculums (web dev to ds, ds to web dev) should have been shut off. \n",
    "    - Do you see any evidence of that happening? Did it happen before?\n",
    "#### 6. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)?\n",
    "#### 7. Which lessons are least accessed?\n",
    "#### 8. Anything else I should be aware of?"
